RespInPeace
===========
RespInPeace is a Python toolkit for processing respiratory data collected using Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP). It provides methods for signal normalisation, calibration, parametrisation as well as for detection of respiratory events, such as inhalations, exhalations and breath holds.

The API can be browsed `here <./api.html>`_. Some examples of how to use RespInPeace can be found `in this Jupyter notebook <https://gitlab.com/mwlodarczak/RespInPeace/blob/master/notebooks/demo.ipynb>`_.
